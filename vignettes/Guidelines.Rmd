# Scope

This is a draft of specifications for further development.

Although **dolka** is devoted to the use of **DiceKriging** and
**rlibkriging**, several packages could be used to provide what we may
call "Kriging Model Objects" (KMOs). The models considered are
stochastic processes $Y(\mathbf{x})$ indexed by a vector $\mathbf{x}$
called "design point", "input".


# R packages devoted for kriging to be used with **dolka**

The methods can be either S3 or S4. However it seems preferable to 
register S3 methods using a suitable call to `setMethod`. 

## Creator

The specification of the creator is up to the package authors. However
it is a sound practice in R that the creator has the same name as the
class. For example if the class is `"niceKrige"` an object will be
created by calling the `niceKrige` function. Also it is often
appreciated by users that default values for the formal arguments allow
to create an object by using only a small number of arguments. For
instance a default kernel type can be proposed.

Also mind that arguments with values in a closed sets of (character)
values can be coped with by using the `match.arg` mechanism. This
simplifies the documentation since the allowed values and the default
value are shown in the **Usage** section of the help. Partial matching
can reduce the effort of the user both for typing and for argument
names reminding. For instance the `predict` method can be used by
giving `new = ` instead of `newdata`.  Although partial matching
should not be used within R packages, it helps at performing quick and
dirty tests or analyses.


## Basic methods

Inasmuch KMOs can be S3 or S4, their content should not be assessed to by 
using a slot extraction `@`or `$`, but by using methods instead. So 
a class of KMOs should have the followif methods.

- `input_n` Number of inputs (number of rows in the design matrix).

- `input_names` Character. Names of the inputs.

- `input_class` Character. Class of the inputs. For now only
  inputs with class `"numeric"` are accepted.
 
- Although not required, it can be appreciated to have the methods that
  are relevant for the class: `coef`, `sigma`, ...
 

## `predict` method

Note that `predict` and `simulate` methods should have similar
arguments because they perform closely related tasks. We could obtain
the prediction mean, variance and covariance by using conditional
simulations.

- `object` The KMO.

- `newdata` Data frame or matrix containing the new inputs. Note that
  `newX` is used in `update`.

**Caution** In a predict method "Ã  la `lm`" the matching of the
columns of `newdata` with those of the inputs in the object does not
depend on the specific order but only on the names. Also `newdata` can
contain columns that are not inputs which can be used in the trend. A
typical example is the output of a cheap simulator. Remind that in R
data frames and matrices behave fairly differently. When binding rows
with `rbind`, the names of the columns we be used with data frames
while only the positions of the columns matter with matrices. This can
lead unexperimented R users to errors that are very difficult to
understand.


An argument `deriv`. When 
`deriv` is `TRUE` the `mean.deriv` and `sd2.deriv`.

## `update` method

Note that this method is used in a different meaning than originally
intended in R, see the `update` method for the class `"lm"`.

- `object` 

- `newX`

- `newy`


## `simulate` method

- `object`

- `nsim`

- `newdata`


A list with the elements 

- `X` A copy of the design given.

- `sim`, a numeric matrix with `nsim`columns.
It seems preferable not to return a matrix, because the simulation can
return other useful results such as the trend or other unobserved
components, ... 

Also the result could have S3 class inheriting from `list`. This is
specially useful to write methods such as `plot`, `autoplot`,
`summary` ...


# Packages implementing Bayesian criteria 

The name of the criteria. However there are constraints on their
arguments.

- The criteria should have the arguments `x` a numeric vector input,
`model` a "kriging model object" with the methods described above. Of
course, `x` must be compliant with `model`. `deriv` (logical)
`out_list` (logical) and `trace` (integer). See `EI_with_grad` for the
meaning.
