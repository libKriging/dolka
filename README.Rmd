# R package dolka

**dolka** is a transitional R package aimed at helping to use
**rlibkriging** as an alternative to **DiceKriging** when doing
Bayesian optimization with **DiceOptim** or when performing kriging
inversion with **KrigInv**.

The name is built as an acronym for *DiceOptim with the LibKriging
Alternative*.

The idea is to rely on R methods, be they S3 or S4, to allow an easy
switch from an object with class `"km"` to an other object with a
different class for instance `"KM"`in the **rlibriging** R
package. The key methods to be enhanced are the `predict` and `update`
methods since most of the tasks in Bayes optimization and kriging
inversion rely on these methods. The method `simulate` is also
important.  In a first step, these methods will be re-implemented in
**dolka** based on existing source codes from the packages cited, in
view of overloading the existing methods for the `"km"` class. Then,
we will suggest some light refactoring to the authors of
**DiceOptim**, **KrigInv** and maybe to those of other packages using
**DiceKriging**, if they want their package to allow the use of both
**DiceKriging** and **libKriging** via its R interface
**rlibkriging**.

Of major importance in Bayesian optimisation, the `predict` method
should be able to provide the derivative of the kriging mean and the
kriging covariance w.r.t. one or several "new" design points. This is
made possible by using the `deriv` argument in the `predict`method for
the class `"km"`provided by **dolka**, which overloads the existing
method when **dolka** is attached.

# News

- The `genoud_cache` and `optim_cache` functions are wrapers for the
  optimization function `genoud` from the **rgenoud** package and
  `optim` from **stats**. In both cases the function to be optimized
  and its gradient are provided as *one single function* returning a
  named list with the elements `objective` and `gradient` as is the
  rule in the **nloptr** package. Compared to using two separated
  functions, this usually allows some savings due to the use of
  auxiliary variables. To stick to the use of `genoud` and `optim` the
  two required functions `fn`and `gr` are created "on the fly" in the
  wrapers, the gradient being "cached" in an environment.
  
- The Bayesian optimization criteria to be optimized at each step
  (Expected Improvement, ...) are and will be provided in versions
  `_with_grad` returning the list with objective and the gradient as
  described above. The computation of the gradient is made optional
  thanks to the `deriv` logical argument, and the functions can return
  simply the numeric value of the objective, possibly with a
  `gradient` attribute. This versatility allows the use of different
  optimization functions e.g. taken from **nloptr**. For now the
  Expected Improvement `EI` and the multi-points a.k.a *q-point*
  Expected Improvement `qEI`.
